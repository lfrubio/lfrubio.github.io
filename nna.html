    <p class="mt-3 ms-4 fs-5">The Neighborhood Network Alliance is a community engagement group that convenes residents around issues and also provides resources to block club leaders. After realizing the Generation X and Millennial populations are not involved in their neighbor or attracted to "Block Clubs," the decision was made to incorporate social networks within their organizing strategy. This led them to incorporate “Network” into their name. They find the next generation of leaders does not find block clubs appealing enough to get involved; they seem to be more attracted to joining a network of like-minded neighbors. In their efforts to create neighborhood networks, they are able to tap into the human capital on the block and identify new leadership while stabilizing neighborhoods. This type of engagement positions them to inspire and attract an intergenerational collective that becomes civically engaged and ready to resolves the neighborhood issues.</p>
